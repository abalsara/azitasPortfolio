Other improvements
- better explain the hotels problem in wireframe/ideation
- better explain the inconsistency in adding locations to the map
- explain how the Pragmatic/Ambitious approach allowed us to define an MVP and address the most pressing problems first, 
and then with any additional time, we could take inspiration from the future form!
- REFLECTION: could have been more useful to do X prototyping rather than iterative 
    - to not box me into one solution (I got stuck for a while on iteration 1)
